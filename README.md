# ArchExample

This is very small apllication, just to demonstrate some of the hexagonal architecture and DDD concepts.

Some of the technologies / techniques used:
- DDD conepts
- Hexagonal architecture elements
- .NET (5.0)
- Angular 11, Bootstrap 4.5.0
- Deployed to Azure
- Cosmos DB as a data store
- Unit tests: xUnit

Please be in mind: still in development: no sophisticated validation, code can be generalized somewhere etc.
